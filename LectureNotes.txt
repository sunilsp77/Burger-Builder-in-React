How do we achieve a build workflow?
1. we need a dependency management tool like npm or yarn because 
   we are gona have so many dependencies like React, React DOM, and many more
2. we need a bundler like webpack, because we need to write modular code split up into multiple files
    but when we ship it , we wana bundle them together.
3. we need a compiler for compiling next gen JavaScript features. Babel
4. we need a development server to test our application locally on our machine.

public folder is the root folder which gets served by the web server

JSX restrictions
1. Some reserved words cannot be used like class, we have to use className 
2. Our JSX expression must have one root element per component - cannot return adjacent elements
